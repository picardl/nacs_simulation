Simulations for Ni Group NaCs 1.5 experiment

**Ellipse**
The ellipse code plots the tweezer polarization ellipse in our experiment. 
For each polarization, the code shows the estimated dipolar interaction strength.

**Dipolar Hamiltonain**
The code creates a Hamiltonian for the dipolar interaction between two molecules. 
It also time-evolves a 2-qubit system under the Hamiltonian.
